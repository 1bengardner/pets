You can interact with your pet in various ways.
* Select a food item, then click "Feed" to reduce your pet's hunger
* "Play" with your pet to increase its happiness
* Click "Sleep" to let your pet rest and restore energy

Some actions take time to perform and will prevent interaction for a short duration.

### Out on the town

Going to town will allow you to explore new areas.
* The pet store sells items to improve your pet's sleep, happiness or beauty
* The salon offers treatments to improve pet happiness and beauty
* The pet show gives your pet an opportunity to compete for money and prizes

Over time and through activities, your pet will gain experience and level up. Watch your pet grow!

### Saving

You can enable "Autosave" to save the game periodically. You can manually save to one of three files from the menu bar with `File > Save > ...`

Load your saved game through `File > Load > ...`
